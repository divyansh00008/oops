        " 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  => Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of designing and writing code that is centered around objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints that define the structure and behavior (properties and methods) of those objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => An object is a real-world entity or a runtime instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => Abstraction means hiding the complex internal details and showing only the essential features of an object whereas encapsulation means binding data  and code  together into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  =>Dunder methods also called magic methods or special methods, are methods in Python that have double underscores before and after their names  like __init__, __str__, __len__, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "  =>Inheritance is a core concept of OOP that allows a class (child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent).\n",
        "\n",
        " 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "  =>Polymorphism allows you to write flexible and reusable code, where the same method name can work differently depending on the object that invokes it.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   =>Encapsulation in Python is achieved using classes to bundle data and methods together.Access to variables is restricted using naming conventions: _var (protected) and __var (private).\n",
        "  \n",
        " 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  =>A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize a newly created object.It is always named __init__() and is automatically called when an object is created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => In Python, class methods use the @classmethod decorator and take cls as the first argument to access or modify class-level data.\n",
        " - Static methods use the @staticmethod decorator and don’t take self or cls;\n",
        "   they behave like regular functions inside a class.\n",
        " - Class methods can affect all instances, while static methods are utility\n",
        "   functions tied to the class.\n",
        " - Both are called using the class name or an instance.\n",
        "\n",
        " 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  =>Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        " 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   =>Method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name and parameters as a method in its parent class, but provides a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        " - It enables runtime polymorphism and allows a child class to customize\n",
        "   behavior inherited from the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        " 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  =>The @property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a   read-only attribute.\n",
        "  It allows you to access getters/setters like attributes while still controlling behavior behind the scenes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  =>Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming because it:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Promotes flexibility – allows one interface to work with different types  \n",
        "   of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Enables code reuse – write general-purpose code that works for many      classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Supports scalability – easily extend systems by adding new classes  \n",
        "     without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        " -  Improves readability and maintainability – simplifies complex logic by\n",
        "     using common method names.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated\n",
        "     directly and is meant to be inherited by other classes.\n",
        "     It can define abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be overridden in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 16.  What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "   \n",
        "  => the advantages of OOP are:\n",
        "    - Modularity\n",
        "    - Reusability\n",
        "    - Scalability & Maintainability\n",
        "    - Abstraction\n",
        "    - Encapsulation\n",
        "\n",
        " 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => Class variables are shared across all instances; instance variables are\n",
        "     unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class variables are defined outside methods, while instance variables are\n",
        "     defined inside methods (usually __init__).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Class variables are accessed via class name or object; instance variables\n",
        "     are accessed via object only.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Changing a class variable affects all instances, but changing an instance\n",
        "     variable affects only that object.\n",
        "\n",
        " 18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit\n",
        "     from more than one parent class.\n",
        "     This means the child class gains properties and behaviors of all parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  => In Python, both __str__() and __repr__() are special (dunder) methods\n",
        "     used to define string representations of objects, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        " a.   __str__(self)\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Used by print() and str().\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Returns a user-friendly, readable string.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " b.   __repr__(self)\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Used by repr() or in interactive console.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Returns a developer-friendly string, ideally something that can recreate\n",
        "   the object.\n",
        "\n",
        " 20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?  \n",
        "\n",
        "  => The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent\n",
        "     (superclass) in a child class.\n",
        "     It  helps in reusing code, especially when overriding methods in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        " 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  => The __del__() method in Python is a destructor.\n",
        "     It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected), allowing you to perform cleanup operations like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        " 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in   Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  =>  the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python :\n",
        "\n",
        "   a. @staticmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "   - @staticmethod does not take self or cls and can't access class or\n",
        "     instance data.\n",
        "   - Use @staticmethod for utility methods related to the class but         independent of it.\n",
        "  \n",
        "   b. @classmethod\n",
        "  \n",
        "   - @classmethod takes cls as the first parameter and can access/modify  \n",
        "     class variables.\n",
        "   - Use @classmethod for factory methods or class-wide operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "   => In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows child classes to\n",
        "      override methods from a parent class, so the same method name behaves differently depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "  24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "   => Method chaining is a technique in Object-Oriented Programming where\n",
        "     multiple methods are called sequentially on the same object in a single line, each returning the object itself.\n",
        "   - Each method returns self, allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "  25.  What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   =>  The __call__() method allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
        "   -   If a class defines __call__, its instances can be invoked using\n",
        "       parentheses — just like a regular function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
